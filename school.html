                <p>In the framework of the Sixth International Conference of CIS Countries «Sol-gel synthesis and research of inorganic compounds, hybrid functional materials and disperse systems» - "SOL-GEL 2020" will be organized an International Young Scientific School “New frontiers in Sol-Gel Materials”.</p>
                <p>The International Young Scientists School is expected to involve young scientists from different countries, as well as lecturers. Lectures will be carried out by the leading world scientists in the field of sol-gel science and technology from Russia, near and far abroad. Oral reports of young scientists and a special poster session with the active participation of young scientists are also planned. The best oral and the best poster presentation will be awarded with certificates and memorable prizes. Abstracts will be published.</p>
                <p>The aim of the Scientific School is to familiarize undergraduate and graduate students and young scientists with modern works in the field of sol-gel technology. Nowadays, sol-gel science and technology has become an extraordinarily multidisciplinary area of research, spanning chemistry, physics, biology, biotechnology, biochemistry, electronics, and related engineering branches, materials science and nanotechnology. Based on this, the range of application of these technologies is very wide.</p>
